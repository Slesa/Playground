  <h4>Welcome to RoadRantz</h4>
  <p>It's an unfortunate reality that almost everyone who drives a car is an idiot.
  In fact, it's quite possible that you are the only one on the road
  who really knows how to drive. Whether it's someone who runs a red light, cuts you off, or is too busy applying
  makeup to keep their car from swerving, there are drivers out there who simply do
  not deserve the privilege of operating a motor vehicle.</p>
  
  <p>Haven't you wished you could get back at them, even if only in some small way?</p>
  
  <p>Don't let road rage get the best of you. Let out your drive-time frustrations
  here at RoadRantz! Leave a message to that #%$#@! that made your drive home less
  enjoyable and let them know what you really think.</p>
  
  <p>And...if it turns out that <i>you</i> are the idiot, you can also check
  in to see what others are saying about you.</p>
