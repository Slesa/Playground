<span class='exampleDropTitle'>Web App&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In software engineering, a <b>web application</b> &mdash; sometimes called a webapp and much less frequently a weblication &mdash; is an application that is <b>accessed with a web browser</b> over a network such as the Internet or an intranet. Web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of the browser as a client, sometimes called a thin client. The ability to update and maintain web applications <b>without distributing and installing software</b> on potentially thousands of client computers is a key reason for their popularity.
